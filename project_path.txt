part 1:
{
    1.download csv file and get to know it
    {
        file: train_dataset/train_Titanic.csv
        explanation:
        891 records.
        {
            according to the page:
            https://cloudxlab.com/assessment/displayslide/2147/titanic-dataset-categorical-variables#:~:text=SibSp%20%2D%20how%20many%20siblings%20%26%20spouses,the%20price%20paid%20(in%20pounds)
            {
                The attributes have the following meaning:

                Survived - that's the target, 0 means the passenger did not survive, while 1 means he/she survived.
                Pclass - passenger class.
                Name, Sex, Age - self-explanatory
                SibSp - how many siblings & spouses of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
                Parch - how many children & parents of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
                Ticket - ticket id
                Fare - the price paid (in pounds)
                Cabin - passenger's cabin number
                Embarked - where the passenger embarked the Titanic
                Hint: You can ignore name, id and ticket# columns because these are just identifiers and don't offer value as a feature.
            }
            so we are gonna delete these columns since they are useless
            the new file without useless columns : train_dataset/1.csv
            valid values:
            {
                survived : 0,1
                Pclass   : 1,2,3
                SibSp    : 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
                Parch    : 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
                Fare     : 0 - 512.3292
                Embarked : C,S,Q
            }
        }
    }

    2.  find columns containing lost values
        provide strategie to handle them:
            columns with lost values:
            {
                age:177 of 891 records without age value. 19% of records.
                Cabin:687 of 891 records without cabin value. 77% of records
                Embarked: 2 of 891 records without embarked value. less than 1% of records.
            }

            strategie:
            {
                for embarked:
                {
                    we will generate a random valid value for 2 records.
                    since only less than 1% all records lack this value.
                }
                for Cabin:
                {
                    since 77% percent of records lack this value,
                    we will delete that columns.
                }
                for age:
                {
                    a specific function will be designed to guess lost values based statistics and probability
                }

            }

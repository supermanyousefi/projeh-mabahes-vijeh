            according to the page:
            https://cloudxlab.com/assessment/displayslide/2147/titanic-dataset-categorical-variables#:~:text=SibSp%20%2D%20how%20many%20siblings%20%26%20spouses,the%20price%20paid%20(in%20pounds)
            {
                The attributes have the following meaning:

                Survived - that's the target, 0 means the passenger did not survive, while 1 means he/she survived.
                Pclass - passenger class.
                Name, Sex, Age - self-explanatory
                SibSp - how many siblings & spouses of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
                Parch - how many children & parents of the passenger aboard the Titanic.
                Ticket - ticket id
                Fare - the price paid (in pounds)
                Cabin - passenger's cabin number
                Embarked - where the passenger embarked the Titanic
                Hint: You can ignore name, id and ticket# columns because these are just identifiers and don't offer value as a feature.
            }
            so we are gonna delete these columns since they are useless
            the new file without useless columns : train_dataset/1.csv
        }
    }
